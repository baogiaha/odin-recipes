                <li>2 tsp (8g) baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp (4g) onion powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp (4g) garlic powder</li>
                <li>0.5 tsp (3g) salt</li>
                <li>1 cup (240 g) marinara sauce</li>
                <li>0.75 tbsp (84g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>For The Crust</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 425F</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, mix the oat flour, egg whites,
                    Greek yogurt, baking powder, salt, onion powder,
                    and garlic powder until combined.</li>
                <li>Spray a mini muffin tin with oil. Put a spoonful
                    of dough into 48 wells. Do your best to get the 
                    wells filled evenly. I find that a small cookie 
                    scoop is easiest but a spoon works as well. With 
                    some practice you'll get better at eyeballing the size.</li>
                <li>Form the dough into the shape of the well. I find 
                    this step easiest if you use a pointy spoon, put 
                    the spoon in the center of the dough, and drag the 
                    back of the spoon up the sides while applying a little 
                    pressure on the well of the muffin tin on all sides. 
                    I like to fill all of the wells first, then go through 
                    and form the wells, then redistribute any dough as needed 
                    to make them more even.</li>
                <li>Parbake the dough for 4-6 minutes</li>     
            </ol>
            <h3>For The Topping</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Measure out the sauce and cheese and pepperoni. 
                    Cut the pepperoni into small pieces to fit on top.</li>
                <li>Top each pizza bite with sauce, cheese, then pepperoni 
                    over the top. Bake for an additional 6-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Storage</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Once the bites are at room temperature, add them to a 
                    Fresh & Save Bag, label the bag with the name and date and freeze.</li>
                <li>o the reheat the pizza bites, air fry or microwave them. 
                    I air fry at 400Â°F until they are hot or microwave them for 
                    1-2 minutes or until thawed based on the power of your microwave. 
                    Air frying to reheat is my preferred method.</li>
            </ol>
